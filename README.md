# Econ-Topic-Evolution

This project is a text analysis study designed for a broader audience outside academia. The aim is to provide an accessible view of how the focus of economics research has shifted over time by analyzing the content of research papers.

## About NBER and Its Working Papers
The **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)** is a private, non-profit research organization based in the United States. Founded in 1920, it is widely regarded as one of the most influential institutions in economics. NBER brings together leading economists from top universities to conduct independent, policy-relevant research.

One of NBER’s most visible outputs is its **Working Paper series**, which began in 1973. These papers are preliminary versions of ongoing research and are released quickly to stimulate discussion and feedback before formal journal publication. Because of this, NBER Working Papers often represent the cutting edge of economic research—many later become highly cited journal articles.

Key reasons why NBER Working Papers are representative of the field:
- **Breadth of coverage**: Topics range from macroeconomics, labor, health, and development to emerging areas such as digital markets and inequality.  
- **Author pool**: Most authors are affiliated with leading institutions (Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Chicago, etc.), ensuring high research quality.  
- **Influence**: Policymakers, journalists, and the wider public often track NBER papers to stay updated on the latest developments in economics.  

In short, analyzing NBER Working Papers gives us a reliable window into the evolution of modern economics research.

The dataset used in this project was downloaded on **August 12, 2025**, and includes metadata and abstracts from thousands of NBER working papers spanning several decades.

## Methods
This project applies a set of text mining techniques to study how economics research topics have evolved, including:
- **Keyword frequency analysis** to track how the use of particular concepts has changed over time.  
- **Topic modeling** (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify recurring clusters of research themes.  
- **Trend visualization** to illustrate the rise and decline of different research areas, such as labor, health, and development economics.  

## Goal
By making the analysis transparent and reproducible, this project seeks to highlight how economic research agendas evolve over time. The broader goal is to provide readers outside academia with an accessible overview of the long-run dynamics of research in economics.
